# Black Spring NFT Project

This project depolys a smart contract to mint NFTs. The NFTs can only be minted by the owner and use the hardcoded private server url. So it is not recommended to be used commercially. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/run.js
node scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat help
```
